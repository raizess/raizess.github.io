	<p class='p2'>  Welcome! This site serves as my spot for posting about various stuff. If you are interested in reading
	about anime and tech-related stuff, then I welcome you! If you have any questions, be sure to check the about-section to see answers to
	most of the usual questions. This site doesn't need the use of any scripts. If noscript warns you of needing to enable one, don't!
	There's absolutely no reason to enable it. It should also serve as an example of how sites should be made, rather than how they are now.
	For examples of great sites that minimizes the use of bloat, see:</p>
